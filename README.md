# Spring Boot Todo API
My first Spring Boot project. I use this project as playground to learn about Spring Boot.

## Installation
The project is created with Maven, so you just need to import it to your favorite IDE and build the project to resolve the dependencies.

## Usage 
Run this command in the terminal:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Or run the project with your favorite IDE and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
